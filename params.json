Declare it through #define, the string associated with it will be the actual title to be displayed in the internal config panel.\r\n\r\n2. Declare its default value (YES or NO) and place it in a array, to indicate where to show on the panel and its default value\r\n\r\n3. Use this defined switch though [YFInternalConfig boolForKey:keyName] and you are done!\r\n\r\nThis utility will take care the rest: display it on panel, store it on user defaults and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
